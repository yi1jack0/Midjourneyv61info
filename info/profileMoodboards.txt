Profiles and Moodboards
Hi everyone, we’re releasing an early version of our new model personalization infrastructure today

Flagship features
You can now have multiple personalization profiles
Setting up personalization is now much faster (up to 5x faster)
You can now personalize models with moodboards of uploaded images
Try it out at midjourney.com/personalize

More Features / Information
Personalization profiles both 'converge' more quickly and need fewer to get started. You'll need 40 ratings to get started, and the profile should be fairly stable by 200. You'll still notice that 2,000 ratings will improve the performance, but you shouldn't practically need 10,000 anymore.
Moodboards take inspiration from the images that you add. As you add more diverse images to the board, the model will start to remix them in more complex ways.
You can name model profiles and select one or many as default
You can see all images made with particular profiles
We hope these features let everyone use personalization, whether you are working on multiple projects or with multiple people.
You're now able to mix together multiple moodboards as well as moodboards with style references. Just add multiple codes like "--sref 142710498 --profile drgmjoi 2jrqbw6"

more details::

Personalization profiles (--p) create images using our own aesthetic preferences.
How do I make a personalization profile?
Your default or global profile is generated when you rank/rate at least 40 images by choosing "Create Standard Profile" @ https://www.midjourney.com/personalize
The default or global profile is entered automatically if you use --p by itself in a prompt.
You can also create named profiles which you can reference with --p code.
There are two kinds of named profiles: built from your ranking, or built from a moodboard which you create yourself.

What are moodboards?
Moodboards are NOT just multi-image style references. That is, they are not the same thing as using --sref URL URL URL URL. This is because sref draws from visual style only, while moodboards also pull composition, color, subject matter, visual conventions, detail level, motifs, vibes, aesthetics, etc.
The variety of input images directly affects output variation: similar images produce uniform styles, while diverse images yield far more complex, blended outputs.
Currently, moo bards max cap at 500 images.

How do I use personalization profiles?
We've marked these items with :Discord: for Discord and 🌐 for website. Otherwise the note works for both!
Type --p after your prompt to use the default/global profile.
Type --p code after your prompt to use a specific profile.
:Discord: Discord Only: Type /list_personalize_codes to show all your profiles.
🌐 Web Only: Manage your profiles using the website @ https://www.midjourney.com/personalize
:Discord: Discord Only: Toggle personalization on permanently (so you do not have to keep typing --p) type /settings and select the [🙋 Personalization] button.
🌐 Web Only: Click the options button and look for 'Personalization: [ON] [OFF]'.
If you want to use someone else's code, use --p code.
:Discord: Discord Only: In Discord public creation channels, you can use --p @name instead. (Won't work in DMs.)

Blending
Use multiple --p codes at once, to blend together different personal styles (6.0 and 6.1 codes won't blend).
Example: --p 1uwjacn 1yjtfcj
Change the influence of the codes using standard weighting syntax.
Example: --p 1uwjacn::1 1yjtfcj::0.5
🌐 On the web, only use whole/natural numbers. Using decimals will throw an error.
You can also blend --p with --sref and --cref and image prompts.
Example: owl --sref 4082972121 --p vlp7b25 r9gm7l6
You can faux-weight by creating duplicate or highly similar boards and referencing them multiple times.
Example: --sref orange --p green blue
Here, the --p would be twice as influential as the style reference, so the image would be mostly cool colors.
Example: --sref red orange yellow --p green
Here, the --sref would be three times as influential, so the image would be mostly warm colors.

More tips.
Order doesn't matter.
Personalization (--p) is a --style, just like --style raw (with which it is fully compatible). This means you can control its "loudness" by using --stylize which is --s 100 by default. The value of 0 is its lowest influence, and the value 1000 is its maximum influence. You can learn more about --s here: ⁠📘 Parameters: --style, --styliz…
If your prompt uses --style raw --p (both) they are blended and --s modifies the amalgam.
