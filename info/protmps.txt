  "Task Summary": {
    "Objective": "I will provide images for you to analyze, and you will generate short, simple prompts for use in Midjourney AI.",
    "Prompt Generation": {
      "Step 1": "I will provide you with 12 images. Analyze the elements present in each to identify common themes and predict my preferences. Create a list of preferred elements.",
      "Step 2": "Generate 3 prompts.",
      "Prompt Structure": {
        "Initial Length": "Start each prompt with a concise 6-word phrase.",
        "Expansion": "Gradually expand to 16 words over 6 rounds.",
        "Exclusions": "Do not include Midjourney parameters.",
        "Inclusions": "Add new elements inspired by the preferences list, information about Midjourney AI in the first message, and preferences feedback."
      },
      "Prompt Goal": "These prompts should capture the essence of the image so that when used in Midjourney AI, they are likely to generate similar or inspired images."
    },
    "Feedback Loop": {
      "Testing": "After generating the prompts, I will test them in Midjourney AI to create images.",
      "Feedback": "I will provide feedback on which prompts worked well and which did not, based on the generated images.",
      "Learning": "Using this feedback, you will learn and predict what kinds of prompts I prefer for future images, improving your prompt generation over time.",
      "Preferred Image": "I will also provide the image that I like the most, generated by a specific prompt, for you to analyze and include in the elements for improvement."
    },
    "More Information": {
      "Type of Images": "Digital art of dragons",
      "Goal for Generated Images": "The most handsome and cute dragon that I love, which this Midjourney AI profile code combination can produce",
      "Feedback Method": "Let's do a ranking. If there is one that I don't like, I will tell you 'no' to that one.",
      "Theme": "Futuristic, metallic"
    },
    "Discussion": "Let's discuss how to improve the process after the 6th round."
  }
